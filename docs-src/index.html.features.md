## Javascript UX/UI is fun, like never before.

For many years, Web Component Frameworks just focus on how to make
**Web Component APIs** look better. Adapter take to another approach
to focus on features which doesn't exist, to bring **CSS** into **OOP**
with **Web Component**

## Easy to start & learn
You can start using **Adapter** without **Node.js** or any
**JS Build Tools**. Just use plain Javascript, right away in your browser.
You can even try it now by open browser console `Ctrl+Shift+I`.

<el-code-block>
    <div el="bar-top-left">
        <b>Javascript</b>
    </div>

```js
Particle.tagStyle(`
    border-radius: 0;
    transform: rotate(45deg);
`)
```

</el-code-block>
