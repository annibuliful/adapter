**CSS** in complex WebApp nowadays is getting messy. Because **CSS**
is just styling language. It lacks of features to scale up and maintain.
However, **Adapter** fix these problems by bringing **CSS**
into **OOP** world with **Javascript** and **\<web-component/\>**.
This is a very easy but powerful solution which leverages **CSS**
to the next level with following advantages:

1. Simple **API**, easy to understand and use.
2. Using **\<web-component/\>** which is standard and works well
   with other tools or frameworks.
3. **CSS** becomes Adaptive, Programmable and can be encapsulted inside
   **\<web-component/\>**

> **Adapter** is just `15KB` javascript minified.
